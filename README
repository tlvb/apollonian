Program for creating Apollonian Gaskets.
Output is a ppm file: apollonian.ppm

Todo:
Right now rendering and file output is the same loop,
if rendering to an intermediate bitmap in memory, and
then writing that to output it should be possible to
parallelize the render, and the file output could
possibly benefit from being able to write larger chunks
at a time.
